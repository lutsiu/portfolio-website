  shortDescription:
    "Student, traveler, guitarist — and a future-focused full-stack developer.",
  greetingsDescription: `I’m Oleksandr Lutsiuk (Sasha), a full-stack developer and Vistula student who enjoys turning ideas into fast, reliable web products. I work across the stack with React/Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind on the front, and Node.js/Express on the back—shipping clean, typed code, reusable components, and simple APIs that are easy to extend. Recently I spent six months at Intercode as a full-stack engineer, delivering a lead-generating site with advanced SEO, i18n, Embla carousels, a Nodemailer contact pipeline, and performance/a11y improvements. I’m pragmatic, product-minded, and care about measurable outcomes: clear UX, quick LCP, and maintainable architecture over clever tricks.

Outside the editor I’m a traveler and guitarist, which keeps my curiosity high and my problem-solving flexible. I’m comfortable owning a feature from brief to production—planning, building, testing, and deploying—and I communicate clearly along the way. I’m open to roles and collaborations where I can build impactful web experiences and keep learning.`,
